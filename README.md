# Orange-HRM-Playwright

This is the project that I did for practising Playwright testing framework with C# and NUnit.

I have selected the website named OrangeHRM for this practise. It is a demo website of HR management. 

Currently, there are 42 tests in total, but this number will increase since I plan to continue working on this project. Tests are divided into sections related to the specific features of the website.

All the packages are downloaded from Nuget and they are as follows:

- NUnit.3.13.3.
- Microsoft.Playwright.1.30.0.
- Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk.16.11.0
- Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit.1.30.0
- Microsoft.Playwright.TestAdapter.1.30.0
- Chromium.ChromeDriver.2.37.
- Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel.17.3.0
 NuGet.Frameworks.5.11.3
 NUnit3TestAdapter.4.0.0
